# Local/remote database configuration
# For each database, provide your connection parameters as either a connection
# string/URI or as an object. Alternatively, you can provide a command that will
# return the connection parameters so you can avoid hardcoding your secrets here.
# You can also specify environment variables for any of the connection
# parameters or for the connection string itself
#
# Examples:
#   - command: vault read env/postgres/conn:string
#   - connection string/URI: postgres://user:password@host:port/database
#   - object:
#       user: $PGUSER
#       host: $PGHOST
#       database: $PGDATABASE
#       password: $PGPASSWORD

local: postgres://localhost:5432/your_db_name

remote:
  user: $PGUSER
  host: $PGHOST
  database: some_db_name
  password: $PGPASSWORD
